<h1>ECE Students&rsquo; Seminar Series</h1>
</div>
<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>Students are given an opportunity to present</p>
<ul>
<li><p>an area or paper that they have studied and would like to share with others, or</p>
</li>
<li><p>a concept they recently gained deeper understanding about, or</p>
</li>
<li><p>their own research work.<br /></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The talk must be for a minimum of 20 minutes and a maximum of 1 hour (can be
relaxed). It could be a whiteboard presentation or a formal talk using slides as long as it is
accessible to a majority in the department. It is encouraged to share recent results that were
published or those that are about /to be published.</p>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>The talks will be in one of the following formats.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Format-1: Two talks of around half an hour each by students.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Format-2: A talk of one hour by a student.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Format-3: A talk of one hour by a guest speaker(students from other departments of universities)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>3MT Competition</h2>
<p>In each seminar, a 3-minute slot is provided for the speakers of the upcoming talks to give a brief introduction to their talk. This will
be in the form of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI8XOGubJyY">3-minute thesis(3MT) talk</a>. At the end of the year, the best 3MT talk will be rewarded.<br /></p>
